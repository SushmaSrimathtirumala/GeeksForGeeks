Given a binary tree, print out all of its root-to-leaf paths one per line.
Asked by Varun Bhatia

Here is the solution.

Algorithm:

initialize: pathlen = 0, path[1000] 
/*1000 is some max limit for paths, it can change*/

/*printPathsRecur traverses nodes of tree in preorder */
printPathsRecur(tree, path[], pathlen)
   1) If node is not NULL then 
         a) push val to path array: 
                path[pathlen] = node->val.
         b) increment pathlen 
                pathlen++
   2) If node is a leaf node then print the path array.
   3) Else
        a) Call printPathsRecur for left subtree
                 printPathsRecur(node->left, path, pathLen)
        b) Call printPathsRecur for right subtree.
                printPathsRecur(node->right, path, pathLen)
                
                 
                       1
                      / \
                     2   3
                    / \
                   4   5
                   
                   1 2 4
                   1 2 5
                   1 3
